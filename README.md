# Minimum-Cost-Route
Consider a city in which there are stores each selling likely different items at likely different prices and in a customer, at a given location, that has a shopping list of items that need to be bought, where some are marked as mandatory and some as optional. The first main task is to find the minimum cost route for the customer in order for them to fulfill their shopping needs with the mandatory items, which may or may not include some of the optional items as well. Considering that some optional items may not be included in the minimum cost route, the second main task is to provide an interface that will allow customers to add (or delete) optional items to the obtained routes in an incremental manner, i.e., building on top of the minimum cost routes already obtained.
